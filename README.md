# Frontend Mentor - Social Proof Section

A responsive social proof section showcasing customer reviews and ratings. This project was a fun, small challenge that allowed me to refine my layout and styling skills. While not overly complex, it reinforced core concepts and provided opportunities to experiment with responsive design.

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 markup**  
- **CSS custom properties** (variables for consistent theming)  
- **Flexbox** (for flexible layouts and alignment)  
- **Media queries** (mobile-first responsiveness)

### What I Learned

This project was a great exercise in **layout precision** and **responsive design**. A few highlights:  

1. **Rating Card Alignment**  
   Ensuring the rating cards aligned elegantly on desktop while stacking cleanly on mobile required careful use of Flexbox and margins. A small but satisfying challenge!  

2. **Background Image Optimization**  
   Balancing two background images (top and bottom patterns) while maintaining performance and responsiveness taught me to fine-tune `background-size` and `background-position` properties.   

Though the project didn’t involve JavaScript, focusing purely on HTML/CSS allowed me to reinforce my understanding of **mobile-first workflows** and **cross-browser consistency**.

### Continued Development  

While I’m happy with the outcome, I’d like to explore more of:  
- **CSS Grid** for more complex layouts in future projects.  
- **Advanced responsive techniques** (e.g., `clamp()` for fluid typography).  
- **Accessibility enhancements**, such as better contrast checks and ARIA labels.  
- **JavaScript**, naturally my next big step to improve upon.

### Humble Wins  
- **Clean code structure**: Minimal redundancy in CSS, thanks to reusable classes and variables.  
- **Pixel-perfect responsiveness**: The design adapts smoothly from desktop to mobile without compromising readability.  
- **Fun factor**: A visually appealing project that reminded me how rewarding frontend development can be!
